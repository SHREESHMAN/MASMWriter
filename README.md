# MASMWriter
Python program to Create, View, Edit and Store MASM programs for 8086 by providing most of the basic features as options in a menudriven program bringing the program writing time down to minutes.
# Features:
  - Auto-saving backups in json format after every edit.
  - Capability to continue working on the last saved or an older program.
  - Capability to load more custom features into the program as options by creating a collection.json file in the 8086 directory.
  - Capability to Read, Write, Rename .asm file directly from the program.
  - Few of the commonly used interrupts, macros, procs present in the program to be added by simple selection (Again can be increased by modifying the
    collection.json file that gets auto detected and loaded as the defaults in the program.
  - Capability to insert/replace any and all lines user-written/auto-generated by the program.

[Description: DISPDEC dict that adds just one DISPDEC procedure (as 'procs' list element 1) and an array to data segment (as 'data' list element 1) used by it and an 'info' string to define its purpose => compulsory.
PRINT dict that adds a single PRINT macro (as 'macs' list element 1) + info. 
The last dixt is  an interrupt consisting of 2 lines where each line is a seperate element of the 'code' array.]
> The dict name isn't displayed and is for your refernce, the info string is the descriptions that is needed by every inner dict and the list names are checked to see what dependencies need to be added for the specific piece of code to work. 
# Coming soon:
  - Import blocks of code/procedures/macros/data from another .asm project

# Requirement:
  - Python 3.6+
